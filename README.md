## üëΩ Introduction to Coding C#

This is an open-source guide to C# learning, my ideia with this repository is to spread learning for the community.

I will talk about advanced topics to more basic topics. Then I will cover several other topics related to the language and its SDKs.

I will add all my knowledge with the language and technologies, so we can always move forward together!

## üìö Folders
| Folder | Objective |
|---|---|
| [topics](/topics/README.md) | Talking about basic topics in C# |
| [00-basic](/topics/README.md) | Talking about basic topics in C# |
| [01-intermediate](/topics/README.md) | Talking about intermediate topics in C# |
| [02-advanced](/topics/README.md) | Talking about advanced topics in C# |
| [bot](/bot/README.md)| An introduction to Bots using C# and .NET Core |
| [challenges](/challenges/README.md)| All the challenges and exercises that I faced in my learning |
| [DLL](/dll/README.md)| An introduction to DLL and how to create and test DLL files |

- All the folders and solutions have one README.md with an extensive documentation
