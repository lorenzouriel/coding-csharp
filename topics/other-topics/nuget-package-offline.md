# Nuget Package Manager Offline
Since your package source is set to "Microsoft Visual Studio Offline Packages," it may not have the latest versions of the necessary libraries like Entity Framework.

To resolve this, you can try the following steps:

### 1. Add a New Package Source for NuGet (Online)
You need to ensure you are using the online NuGet package source, which contains the latest libraries.

#### Steps to Update Your Package Source:
1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Go to Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Settings.
3. In the Package Sources section, ensure the nuget.org source is available. If itâ€™s not:
    - Click the + button to add a new source.
    - Set Name as nuget.org.
    - Set Source as https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json.
    - Click Update and OK.

### 2. Restore Packages
Once you have the correct package source, restore the missing packages:
1. Right-click your solution in Solution Explorer and select Manage NuGet Packages.
2. Under Browse, search for `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` and install the correct version for your project.
3. Once installed, rebuild the solution and check if the errors are resolved.

### 3. Alternative (If Offline)
If you are restricted to using offline packages:
1. Ensure the correct package versions are available offline.
2. You may need to manually download the necessary NuGet packages (e.g., Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore) from https://www.nuget.org/, then install them locally.
    - After downloading, go to Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Settings.
    - In Package Sources, add a new source pointing to the folder where you've placed the downloaded .nupkg files.
